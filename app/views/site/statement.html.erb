<p class="art_state"><span class="dropcap">I</span> think my recent work reflects the time-honored practice of taking common, ordinary images and objects and placing them in an artistic context, but with a little twist: I select images or things that are or were at home in ordinary human life and commerce but have some extra significance, which is carried over into their artistic incarnation. For example, over the past several years I have created a series of "Hobo Prints," etching’s of the graphic signs that 1930s hobos used to communicate with each other. These signs were drawn, usually in chalk, on sidewalks, fences, barns, railroad cars and the like, and conveyed simple but important messages — e.g., "dangerous drinking water," "nice lady lives here, " "okay to sleep in hayloft." One of my prints depicts the sign meaning "Don’t give up." The casual passer-by would seldom notice the signs, and their meaning would certainly escape him or her. Similarly, to the unknowing viewer my images will be pleasant shapes; but to one who knows their history and significance, they will speak from another time. </p>
	<p class="art_state2">I have also created a series of etching that physically incorporate French  postage stamps — ordinary commercial objects, but ones that reproduce, in miniature, paintings by Ingre, Seurat and others. In these prints I use the little (postage-stamp-sized!) painting for inspiration and draw out a larger surrounding composition from it. There is no attempt to "improve" on the painting, of course, simply a light-hearted attempt to embed it in a context. Again, I try to incarnate the ordinary in art, but what is ordinary in this case was itself art, now reduced to a simple postage stamp. </p>
<p class="art_state2">	After the World Trade Center tragedy of 9-11-01 I felt the need to create a print depicting this "911" horror. As an artist this was my way to deal with such an enormous American tragedy and loss of lives. From this single print, which I have named "The System Was Blinking Red," I have continued to create a series of prints using the numbers "911" to signify all emergencies. My other prints refer to the Iraq war, election problems, failing schools, Darfur and the environment. </p>
<p class="art_state2">I have etched the numbers "911" into an etching plate and used chine collé to identify  particular "911" events with photos from newspapers, magazines, and other sources. After the Katrina disaster I have started a new series using the letter "X" to symbolize the mark placed on deserted houses after they were inspected. I have included on my website a Marcel Proust series of his characters from Remembrance  of Things Past  and various other prints.</p>
